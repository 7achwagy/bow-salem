    <p class="k"><b>
        One hell of a man, Bow Salem! Born in 2002 this man is a professor born in Jandouba he studied in Bow Salem University and later went to teach Zaqlawi. He after he fought valiantly against Ohio's former king, managed to unify the now independent country under his wise rule. After 10 of his peaceful yet unyielding rule, a dangerous enemy had set their sites on Bow Salem's domain; Russia. Puttin had indeed decided to invade Ohio through a ruthless war. But he did not account for Bow Salem's cunning sharp mind, as he managed conquer Russia after he completely destroyed it's former ruler after a 4 year long war and thus Bow Salem became Russia's ruler. He spent 20 years in Russia to fully instate his rule and destroy opposing factions and rebellions.
He, after this long and arduous  period had passed, decided to go back to his roots and visit Jandouba as he missed his wife Bow Salema who remained in their home country. As he entered his old house he laid eyes on an elderly woman that looked familiar. "No it couldn't be!" he thought, yet the truth was plainly obvious, the woman that stood before him was none other than his wife. He in his conquest had lost track of time and he stayed too far for too long from his beloved wife not taking into account his immortality. He looked at the woman with sorrowful eyes and got close to her bed, she was pale as a corpse barely breathing yet she somehow managed to conjure the strength to open her eyes, shed a tear as she looked at her husband and  say "I ... l-ove  you" as her soul was leaving her body leaving her corpse with a satisfied and fulfilled smile. Bow Salem, strong as he is, couldn't contain his emotions as tears started running down his sorrowful face. He loved his wife so much he would've gladly gave up his immortality if it meant he could save her, yet what was done was done. as he stared silently at her now lifeless corpse he decided to continue living and ruling justly for her sake after all it was her that encouraged him to take over Ohio. And so this legend continued his conquest as he finally managed to unify the world under his omnipotent rule in 2051.
